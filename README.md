this is a simple CTF bot project using pydantic-ai and gemini-1.5-flash to solve challenges.

## plans

- incorporate reverse engineering capabilities into the agent using ghidra.
- rop chain generation, shellcode generation, etc.
- when streaming for gemini is fixed in pydantic-ai, stream everything including the tool calls and tool outputs.
